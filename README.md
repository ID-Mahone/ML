# Machine Learning Classification


This repository is a part of my learning journey in Machine Learning, particularly in the area of classification. It provides hands-on examples using Python and popular libraries like scikit-learn. The goal is to understand the theory behind different classification techniques and apply them to practical datasets.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Techniques for cleaning and preparing datasets.
- **Multiple Classifiers**: Implementations of various classification algorithms.
- **Model Evaluation**: Methods for evaluating model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
- **Visualization**: Visualizing decision boundaries and model performance.

## Algorithms Implemented

- **Logistic Regression**
- **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
- **Decision Trees**
- **Random Forest**
